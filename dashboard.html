                    Breed: Pitbull<br>

                    <!-- Description about the pet -->
                    Sadie is a very sweet girl with a great temperament. Her previous owner has sadly passed and so she
                    is in need of a loving home. We are told by relatives of her previous owner that Sadie is great with
                    children of any age and loves to go on walks in the park. Her favorite game is Tug-of-War and she
                    comes with a basket of stuffed toys from her previous home. If you're interested in giving this good
                    girl a home, please contact us!

                <!-- Pet details -->
                <p>
                    Breed: Alaskan Husky<br>
                    Age: 1yr<br><br>
                    <!-- Description about the pet -->
                    Lobo's story is a comeback for the ages. We found this poor guy in on the side of the highway after
                    a concerned motorist called us to report an abandoned pup. Tragically, when our retrieval team
                    arrived on the scene, Lobo had already been struck by a passing vehicle. Our driver rushed him to
                    the animal hospital and, despite multiple fractures, Lobo made a full recovery! He now sprints at
                    full speed across our play yard with his new friends. We would love to see this growing boy go to a
                    forever home with a person or people who can give him the attention and love he needs.
